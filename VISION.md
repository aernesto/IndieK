- Develop an intelligent digital assistant with which the user can communicate in natural language, and via freehand drawing and writing. One source of inspiration is the fictional [JARVIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wx7RCJvoCMc) program from the _Iron Man_ movies; another one is [this software](https://youtu.be/PJqbivkm0Ms), used in the _Minority Report_ movie.

- Promote learning via the use of metacognition  
- Promote debating via the use of metacognition  
- Promote scientific skepticism

- Promote creation of objective knowledge  
- Promote creation of public knowledge  
- Foster questioning and curiosity  
- Use machines as cognitive prosthetics to enhance our capacities, e.g. memory and metacognition (organization of one's own thoughts)  
- Seamless integration between machines and human cognition  
- Provide easy access to formal mathematical knowledge to the layman
