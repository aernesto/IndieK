# IndieK
A Free Software to manage your thoughts and documents!

IndieK is very young, in its _embryonic stage_, I like to say. And this is why it _needs_ you! Apply to the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/indiek) in order to _ask questions_ and _offer suggestions_.

Currently, IndieK runs on Linux and relies primarily on bash and MySQL. Watch these [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSA4KEFhVLk&list=PLJhmxsk-_V30bt1XSgXav3dLp0qyEegnD) to get **get started**!

Full documentation is available on the App's [website](https://aernesto.github.io/IndieK/).
