## What IndieK is about
IndieK is currently in its _embryonic_ stage of development. There is, therefore, a huge gap between what it is and what it aims to be. This program aims at enhancing individual cognitive capabilities. It focuses on helping its users handle digital information.

For the philosophy behind IndieK, you may check out the [VISION.md](https://github.com/aernesto/IndieK/blob/master/VISION.md) file, and watch this [blog](https://adrianblogtech.wordpress.com/).

## A few details
Currently, IndieK runs on Linux and Mac OS X, relying primarily on bash and MySQL. Watch these [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSA4KEFhVLk&list=PLJhmxsk-_V30bt1XSgXav3dLp0qyEegnD) to **get started**!

Full documentation is available on the app's [website](https://aernesto.github.io/IndieK/).
